# Nobara-Neon

Modified iso maker script for Nobara Linux.

## Description

Inspired by KDE Neon's default installation and by [Fedora KDE Minimal Install script for Fedora](https://github.com/Zer0CoolX/Fedora-KDE-Minimal-Install-Guide), I edited the Nobara KDE script to better fit my low end intel laptop, in order to be as minimal as possible and yet to be very functional, at least for personal taste. Be ware of this last note, as it might not be friendly with AMD or NVIDIA powered systems.
